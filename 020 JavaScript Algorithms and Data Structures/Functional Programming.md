# Functional Programming

Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope: `INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT`

Functional programming is about:

1. Isolated functions - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change

2. Pure functions - the same input always gives the same output

3. Functions with limited side effects - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled




### Functional terminology:

***Callbacks*** are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in `filter`, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are ***first class*** functions.

The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called ***higher order*** functions.

When functions are passed in to or returned from another function, then those functions which were passed in or returned can be called a ***lambda***.


### Principles ofr functional programming

- Do not change things

Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

In functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a side effect. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

- Always declare your dependencies explicitly. 

This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

- The function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

```js
// the global variable
var bookList = ["The Hound of the Baskervilles", "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies", "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica", "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae"];

/* This function should add a book to the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before bookName

// Add your code below this line
function add(arr, bookName) {
  let newArr = [...arr]; // Copy the bookList array to a new array.
  newArr.push(bookName); // Add bookName parameter to the end of the new array.
  return newArr; // Return the new array.
}

/* This function should remove a book from the list and return the list */
// New parameters should come before the bookName one

function remove(arr, bookName) {
  let newArr = [...arr]; // Copy the bookList array to a new array.
  if (newArr.indexOf(bookName) >= 0) {
    // Check whether the bookName parameter is in new array.
    newArr.splice(newArr.indexOf(bookName), 1); // Remove the given paramater from the new array.
    return newArr; // Return the new array.
  }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time');
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');
var newestBookList = remove(add(bookList, 'A Brief History of Time'), 'On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies');

console.log(bookList);

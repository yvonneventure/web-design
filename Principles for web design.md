#### How to combine fonts


When you’re combining different typefaces, usually you’ll have a different typeface for the heading and a different one for the body. And this is to create a slight contrast and interest in your designs.

Some of the common rules that designers use when they combine different fonts :

![Good-design](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103771536/169720377-98066025-a3dd-4928-b6b6-ac88839f8809.jpg)


1. The Serifs and Sans-Serif work really well together. It tends to create a good design. Sans-Serif have slightly increased readability compared to Serifs. Which is why Sans-Serif is a great typeface for the body of text.
Don’t combine a Serif with a Serif and a Sans-Serif with a Sans-Serif because it can look a little bland and undifferentiated.
2. Too many fonts in one design is not a good thing. It ends up looking too strange. Stick to 2 fonts (one from Serif family and the other from Sans-Serif).
3. Appreciate the mood of the typeface just like colors. And don’t combine different moods together. Try to combine more modern fonts with modern fonts and older fonts with more traditional ones. If you get the mood of your typefaces, you start to create some incredibly beautiful designs.
  - Things that you should keep similar: Mood and Time era of the font
  - Things that you should contrast: Serif-ness (for instance, one font should be Serif and the other Sans-Serif) and Weights.
  -  Weight means how heavy or bold your text is. Most design software have a whole range of weights. For example, light, medium, bold, extra bold, and so on. Play around with different weights contrasting them to create interesting designs.

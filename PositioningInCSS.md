# Positioning in HTML & CSS

  - relative to it's normal flow postion
  - can be used with `left` `right` `top` `bottom` to change it's position
  - won't affect other elements' position


- Absolute position: 
  - to lock it's position relative to it's parent position
  - usually set it's parent position to relative
  - absolute position will take the element out of the normal flow (the element around it will change position), so make sure it has a parent element with relative position.

- Fixed position:
  - usually used on navigation bar, so that it will stick on top even when scrolled
  - position is fiexed ralative to browser window
  - element will be moved out of the normal flow (the elements behind it will shift up)

- Float:
  - take the element out of the normal flow, and relative to it's parent element
  - usually float left or right
  - use with width, elements can at the same level

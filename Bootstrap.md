## WireFrame - Step 1 of Web Design

- wireframe vs. mockup

  - Before writing any codes, we should get buy-in on the design and be able to iterate through your design process
  - wireframe is a low fidelity representation of your design, it meant to be fast to produce and a sketch of the basics(layout and structure) of your design
  - Mock-up is a high fidelity representation of your design, what you see is what you will get, in terms of detailed color,img, icon design.

> - first, take a look at other people's website for inspiration - eg.[awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/com/)
> - then, look at the [UI patterns](https://ui-patterns.com/patterns) to see what problems you are trying to solve.
> - anther great resource of other web designer's portfolio is [dribble](https://dribbble.com/search/website) and you can search by color
> - sketch online use [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/)
> - or wireframe use pencil and paper and download template from [sneakpeekit](https://sneakpeekit.com)

## Use Bootsrap

- use Bootstrap for basic layout and structure design, then use css for fine-tuning and detailed design

# Managing Packages with NPM

npm (Node Package Manager), is a command line tool to install, create, and share packages of JavaScript code written for Node.js.

The `package.json` file is the center of any Node.js project or npm package. It stores information about your project, similar to how the `<head>` section of an HTML document describes the content of a webpage. It consists of a single JSON object where information is stored in key-value pairs. 

There are only two required fields; "name" and "version", but itâ€™s good practice to provide additional information about your project that could be useful to future users or maintainers.

If you look at the file tree of your project, you will find the `package.json` file on the top level of the tree. 

One of the most common pieces of information in this file is the `author` field. It specifies who created the project, and can consist of a string or an object with contact or other details.
